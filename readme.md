# Extend EmailOctopus for WooCommerce

Add subscibribers via the WooCommerce checkout page to your EmailOctopus mailing list. Right now the EmailOctopus app doesn't support ecommerce features like orders or products. But it's still interesting and possible to use EmailOctopus for your webshop with WooCommerce. Using this WooCommerce extension it's possible to sync product categorie, coupon purchase date information together with the other subsciber information. This information can be used to create targetted email campaigns in EmailOctopus.

To use this plugin, you need to create an API key on [this page](https://emailoctopus.com/api-documentation). First of all, you need your own EmailOctopus account. Register a free account [right here](https://emailoctopus.com/?ali=cb359bbf-1b33-11ea-be00-06b4694bee2a).
